## **Pandas projects:**
This repository shows my pandas projects that I've been doing during the "Pandas Data Science with Pandas" course.

Here I implemented:
* Data Analysis
* Data Cleaning
* Data Transforming
* Data Visualization
* Explanatory Analysis

Alongside with that, I used additonal techniques, such as:
* Web Scraping
* Working with Web APIs and JSON
* Working with SQL databases (SQLite)
