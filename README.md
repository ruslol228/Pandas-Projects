## **Pandas projects:**
This repository shows my `Pandas` projects that I've been doing during the **"Pandas Data Science with Pandas"** course.

Here I implemented:
* Data Analysis
* Data Cleaning
* Data Transforming
* Data Visualization
* Explanatory Analysis

I also covered ML-related techniques, such as:
* Data Preprocessing
* Feature Engineering

Alongside with that, I used additonal techniques, such as:
* Web Scraping
* Working with Web APIs and JSON
* Working with SQL databases (SQLite)
